# vrp-rl

A Python Implementation of REINFORCE with baseline in combination with an ant colony optimization algorithm to solve capacitated vehicle routing problems.

# Project Origin

This project was developed as part of my bachelor thesis and provides a prototype for solving capacitated vehicle routing problems. I had 8 weeks to work on it and it was the first major machine learning project of mine. The project originated from my student job at a "last mile" logistics company, where I noticed that we were not doing our route planning efficiently. I noticed that we were always looking at the same problem context and I identified the opportunity to apply a machine learning approach.
